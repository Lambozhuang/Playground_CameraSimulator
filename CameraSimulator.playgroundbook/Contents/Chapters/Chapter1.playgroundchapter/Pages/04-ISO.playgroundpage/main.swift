 # ISO
 ___
 ### This page will show you what is "ISO" in camera and how it affects the photo
 ___
 Have you ever heard about the word "ISO"?
 
 If not, it's fine. Because most phones and cameras have already make the process automatic. But in cameras, you can still adjust this value manually to fit your photographic situation.
 ___
 Before we start, we need to know what is "ISO".
 
 ISO is one of three elements that control the camera's exposure.
 
 For digital photography, ISO refers to the **sensitivity** of the camera's sensor. In another word, ISO refers the signal gain of the sensor.
 
 In very basic terms, ISO is simply a camera setting that will **brighten** or **darken** a photo. As you increase your ISO value, your photos will grow progressively brighter.
 
 For that, ISO can help you capture brighter images in some situations. Like if you want to take a photo at night outside, and it's very dark, and unfortunatelly you also don't have something else except your hands to hold the camera stable for a longer exposure time to gather enough light. In this case, you can increase the ISO value setting to let the sensor capture more light in the same exposure time.

 - Now you can press **Run My Code** button to start the simulation and try to change the value of the ISO setting, and see how the photo changes.
